  <h1>2019 annual report</h1>
  <p>FY2019 marks our 20th anniversary, and we’d like to open this report with a big THANK YOU to the entire Ohana. It’s been a wild ride, and we’d never have made it this far without you. When we started this company, we had a tiny office (that’s it at the bottom of the page) and a huge vision: to work for more than just the bottom line, and to drive change in the world around us. Together, we’ve worked hard to turn that vision into a reality, and, even more importantly, we’ve encouraged others to do the same. As you read this over, we hope you’ll take some time to reflect on the incredible company we’ve built together, and the difference we’ve made for our customers and our communities</p>

<h3>fellow shareholders,</h3>
<p>As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Salesforce, we couldn’t be more excited about the future. In everything we do, we remain committed to our core values — trust, customer success, innovation, and equality. Around the world, companies continue to make incredible investments in their customer experience — becoming more customer-centric, more efficient, and more automated. And when they invest in their digital transformation, they look to Salesforce, the global CRM leader and one of the world’s most admired companies.</p>
<p>By upholding the trust of our customers and by focusing relentlessly on their success, Salesforce delivered another record fiscal year in 2019, surpassing $13 billion in annual revenue and reaching this milestone faster than any enterprise software company in history. With this strong growth, we’re now on track to organically double our revenue in the next four years, with a new revenue target of $26 to $28 billion in FY23.</p>
<p>This year, we continued to deepen our strategic relationships with companies of every size and across every industry around the world. In fact, our $20 million-plus relationships grew 48% over last year. We also strengthened our partnerships with Google and AWS and formed a brand-new partnership with Apple to deliver even more value to our customers. With our integrated and intelligent Salesforce Customer Success Platform, no other CRM company gives businesses a unified view of their customers across every touchpoint — sales, service, marketing, commerce, communities, integration, and more.</p>
